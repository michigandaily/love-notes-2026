Oh my gosh what a joy to have you by my side this year. Between you and me I’ve always thought you were the coolest. I felt it in my bones you would come to UMich but never did I think that you would not only live right next door but quickly become one of my closest friends. Watching TV shows, crafting, eating snacks, printmaking, and going to the Daily together what more could I ask for!! You have grown SO much this year. Seriously holy shit you’re so talented. I can’t wait to see more of what you do. To many more front pages!! AND couldn’t be more excited to live with you next year <333"},{"Timestamp":"2/5/2026 17:08:26","Your email":"tejasdu@umich.edu","Sender Name (If you want to be anonymous, leave this blank!)":"","Receiver Name":"Chandan Pothuri","Receiver Email":"cpothuri@umich.edu","Message":"I am deeply and incandescently in love with you.
